# 🧠 AI Security Projects

This repository showcases two of my main projects combining **Applied AI** and **ML Security**.  
They demonstrate my approach to building innovative, reliable, and safe machine learning systems.

## 🪲 1. Pest Detection using Deep Learning
A computer vision project that classifies crop pest images using a convolutional neural network (TensorFlow/Keras).

**Highlights:**
- Image detection and classification  
- Data augmentation and preprocessing pipeline  
- Achieved ~86% validation accuracy  
- Built a simple Streamlit demo for quick testing

## 🧩 2. Malicious Code Injection in Machine Learning Models (TFG)
Final Degree Project focused on exploring and mitigating vulnerabilities in ML model serialization and supply chains.

**Highlights:**
- Studied multiple attack vectors across PyTorch and TensorFlow (including `__reduce__`, custom deserialization hooks, pickle/HDF5/SavedModel issues)  
- Analyzed supply-chain risks (e.g., models shared on Hugging Face, GitHub)  
- Implemented controlled proof-of-concept experiments for research (non-destructive)
