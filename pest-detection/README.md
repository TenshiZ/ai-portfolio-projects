# 🪲 Pest Detection using Deep Learning

This project applies **computer vision and deep learning** to detect and classify crop pests from images.  
It is implemented as a single, well-documented **Jupyter Notebook (`insect.ipynb`)** to showcase the full pipeline — from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

---

## 🧠 Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a practical use case of **AI for agriculture**, building a small yet effective image classifier using TensorFlow/Keras.

**Notebook:** [`insect.ipynb`](./insect.ipynb)

**Core workflow:**
1. Load and preprocess pest image dataset  
2. Apply data augmentation and normalization  
3. Train a CNN-based classifier (transfer learning)  
4. Evaluate results (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix)  
5. Visualize predictions and metrics

## 📈 Results
- Achieved **~86% validation accuracy** on a small custom dataset  
- Stable generalization through augmentation and transfer learning  
- Includes plots for loss/accuracy evolution and confusion matrix  

*(Exact results depend on dataset version and preprocessing parameters.)*
